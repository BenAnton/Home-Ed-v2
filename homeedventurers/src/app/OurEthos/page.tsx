                    </h1>
                    <p>Our resources are built around curiosity and rhythm, not timetables or checklists.
                        Each season brings a new invitation to explore — from the first buds of spring to the cozy hibernation of winter.

                        Through story-led adventures, families can:

                        Learn through play and nature

                        Discover the magic in everyday life

                        Build connection and confidence in their home education journey


                        Home Edventurers is a place to feel supported, inspired, and reminded that you’re already doing enough — because your love, your curiosity, and your time together are the magic.
                    </p>

                    <h1 className="our-chars-heading">Our Characters</h1>
                    <p>Gnomes are more than just storybook characters; they're symbols of a slower, more grounded way of life. Rooted in nature, tradition, and quiet wisdom, gnomes represent the values that shape this Home Edventurers; curiosity, care, and connection.
                    </p>

                    <p>Gnomes live in harmony with the land, tending to forests, gardens, and animals with quiet dedication. They notice the small things, move at a thoughtful pace, and find joy in simple daily rituals. Just like a child learning through wonder.
                    </p>

                    <p>Their world is one of handmade treasures, seasonal rhythms, and cosy homes filled with purpose. Gnomes remind us that learning doesn’t need to be rushed or loud, it can be gentle, joyful, and deeply meaningful.</p>
